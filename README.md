These are the instructions about the "**purchase**" event:

- "push" the code when the user has reached the final TY page (in the case if there are upsells for example).
- If a user then refreshes the page, or visit it later (via email for example), do not "push" it again (to prevent double tracking).
- The data layer script is placed just above the GTM snippet in the head of the document.
- If you have any doubts please message me on Slack or email me.
